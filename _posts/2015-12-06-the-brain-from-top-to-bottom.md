description: 'Long-term depression ( LTD) is a phenomenon that is the opposite of long-term potentiation (LTP). In LTD, communication across the synapse is silenced. LTD plays an important role in the cerebellum, in implicit procedural memory, where the neural networks involved in erroneous movements are inhibited by the silencing of their synaptic connections.'
