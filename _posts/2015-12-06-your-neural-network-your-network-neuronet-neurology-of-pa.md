description: "Your Neural Network Cells that fire together, wire together. Donald Hebb, PhD. The more you use a connection the stronger it gets, if you stop using the connection the neurons are pruned away! Use it or lose it! Each person is wired differently, because each person has a different combimation of life's experiences!"
