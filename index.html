This plasticity is manifested chiefly through the phenomenon of long-term potentiation (LTP), which was discovered in the hippocampus in 1973 but has subsequently been demonstrated in many regions of the cortex. The most interesting characteristic of LTP is that it can cause the long-term strengthening of the synapses between two neurons that are activated simultaneously. In other words, exactly the kind of association mechanism that Hebb had imagined 25 years earlier.  What happens is that when the axons that make connections to the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus are exposed to a high-frequency stimulus, the amplitude of the excitatory potential measured in these neurons is increased for a long period (up to several weeks).  Glutamate, the neurotransmitter released into these synapses, binds to several different sub-types of receptors on the post-synaptic neuron. Two of these sub-types, the receptors for AMPA and NMDA, are especially important for LTP.  The AMPA receptor is paired with an ion channel so that when glutamate binds to this receptor, this channel lets sodium ions enter the post-synaptic neuron. This influx of sodium causes the post-synaptic dendrite to become locally depolarized, and if this depolarization reaches the critical threshold to trigger an action potential, the nerve impulse is transmitted to the next neuron.  The NMDA receptor is also paired with an ion channel, but this channel admits calcium ions into the post-synaptic cell.

This increased concentration of calcium in the dendrite sets off several biochemical reactions that make this synapse more efficient for an extended period.  To let the calcium enter the cell, the NMDA receptor must be activated by glutamate and subjected to depolarization simultaneously.
